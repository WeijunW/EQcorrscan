Since October 2015 EQcorrscan has been listed on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/EQcorrscan/0.0.8); as such installation
is as simple as:

**pip install EQcorrscan**

Updating should be done using the following command:

**pip install -U --no-deps EQcorrscan**

This will ignore dependency updates, which have not been needed so far, if this
changes you will be notified along with the release update.
