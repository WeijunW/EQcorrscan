    <p>Welcome to EQcorrscan.</p>
<p>These pages make up the general documentation of the EQcorrscan project,
  the full API can be found
  <a href="http://eqcorrscan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest">here</a>.
  This project is an open source, Python project for the detection and analysis
  of repeating and near-repeating earthquakes. The codes are hosted on
  <a href="https://github.com/calum-chamberlain/EQcorrscan">github</a>, with
  the latest release also available on
  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/EQcorrscan/0.0.8">pypi</a>.</p>
  
<p>This project is in constant development, although the core routines are
  relatively stable. Before we migrate to a 0.1.0 release we plan on
  implementing more tests and adapting the code to more pep8 friendly style
  (currently we mostly follow pep8 guidelines, but we are always learning!).</p>

<p>You can find more details about the project on the
  <a href="about">About</a> page, and details on how to install and update
  on the <a href="Installation">Installation</a> page.</p>
